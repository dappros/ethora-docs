# About the chat component

We are excited to introduce the preliminary version of our first npm package: **ethora-chat-component**. This package is designed to provide developers with a quick and easy way to integrate a chat room into their web applications.

Although currently using a temporary name and design for testing purposes, the core functionality of the "ethora-chat-component" remains robust and effective. Our goal is to offer a streamlined solution that allows developers to swiftly set up a chat room and understand its workings.

For a considerable time, developers and builders have benefited from the open-source Ethora engine, available on GitHub:

However, we recognize that some developers prefer a simpler starting point or need to integrate specific engine components into their existing applications. There are also instances where a lighter version of the Ethora client is required, such as just the chat feature, a digital wallet/profile, or an AI bot. These components might need to run as standalone web apps or be embedded within a website as a widget or plugin.
